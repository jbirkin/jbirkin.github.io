As a member of the international [CRISTAL: [CII] Resolved ISM in Star-Forming Galaxies with ALMA](https://www.alma-cristal.info/) collaboration, my role is to combine the 3-D data from CRISTAL to boost the signal-to-noise ratio and identify faint emission features. For this project, I have utilized dimensionality reduction techniques, data normalization, MCMC model fitting, model selection, bootstrap/jackknife resampling, and feature engineering.
