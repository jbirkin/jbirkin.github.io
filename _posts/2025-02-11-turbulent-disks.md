In grad school, I led the processing and analysis of a ~300GB Large Program, with the goal of understanding the 2-D kinematics of highly star-forming systems. The data processing and cleaning involved PCA analysis and sigma clipping to reduce noise. After cross-matching the data with existing databases, I applied an adaptive binning technique to model the 3-D data and extract 1-D rotation curves for the galaxies. Below is a visualization of the rotation fields of each galaxy in the sample, plotted as a function of two basic system properties.
