# Exploring High-z SMGs: Catalog Matching, SQL Queries, and Confusion Limits

In my journey to identify high-redshift (z \~7 and beyond) submillimeter galaxies (SMGs), Iâ€™ve been working with multi-wavelength catalogs from **SPT3G, MeerKAT, and SPIRE**. Hereâ€™s a summary of what Iâ€™ve learned and how Iâ€™ve used SQL to filter and explore these datasets.

## ðŸ“Š 1. SQL Queries to Cross-Match Catalogs

### Finding SPIRE Dropouts for High-z Candidates

SPIRE dropouts (sources detected in SPT but not in SPIRE) can indicate z > 5 galaxies.

```sql
SELECT s.spt3g_id, s.ra, s.dec, s.flux_1p4mm, sp.flux_500um, mk.flux_radio
FROM spt3g s
LEFT JOIN spire sp ON s.spt3g_id = sp.source_id
LEFT JOIN meerkat mk ON s.spt3g_id = mk.source_id
WHERE s.flux_1p4mm > 10  -- Bright SPT source
  AND (sp.flux_500um IS NULL OR sp.flux_500um < 5)  -- SPIRE dropout
  AND (mk.flux_radio IS NOT NULL AND mk.flux_radio < 0.1);  -- Faint MeerKAT detection
```

This query combines data from multiple catalogs to flag sources likely to be high-z SMGs.

## ðŸ§ª 2. SPIRE Confusion Limit: Can We Trust Low-Flux Sources?

- **SPIRE confusion limits**: \~5.8 mJy (250Âµm), 6.3 mJy (350Âµm), 6.8 mJy (500Âµm). Sources below these limits are usually unresolved blends.
- **Can we have sources below the confusion limit?** Yes, if they were detected via:
  - **Deblending techniques** using SPT or MeerKAT priors.
  - **Stacking analysis** or **matched-filtering**.

### Filtering Potential Artifacts with SQL

```sql
SELECT *
FROM spt3g
WHERE flux_500um < 6.8  -- Below confusion limit
  AND snr > 5           -- High confidence detection
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM meerkat
    WHERE meerkat.source_id = spt3g.source_id
  );
```

This query ensures only significant detections with MeerKAT priors are kept.

## ðŸš€ 3. Matching SPT3G Sources to SPIRE Footprints

### Finding Sources Inside the SPIRE Footprint

```sql
SELECT *
FROM spt3g
WHERE ra BETWEEN min_spire_ra AND max_spire_ra
  AND dec BETWEEN min_spire_dec AND max_spire_dec;
```

When using a polygon footprint from a SPIRE image, I learned to exclude internal NaN regions to avoid false matches.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways

- âœ… **SPIRE dropouts** are valuable high-z SMG candidates.
- âœ… Be cautious with **sources below the SPIRE confusion limit**â€”use priors or cross-matches.
- âœ… Use **SQL queries with spatial filters** to refine your catalog matches.
