									<h1>Research Interests</h1>
									<p>Below is a summary of my current research projects:</p>

								<h2>TEMPLATES and SPT-SMG collaborations</h2>
									<p>I am currently involved with the JWST Early Release Science Programme
										<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jwst-templates/">TEMPLATES: Targeting Extremely
											Magnified Panchromatic Lensed Arcs and their Extended Star Formation</a>, an on-going
										programme designed to spatially resolve the star formation in four galaxies at the peak of
										cosmic star formation (see the figure below, by
										<a href="https://astro.illinois.edu/directory/profile/kphadke2">Kedar Phadke</a> at the
										University of Illinois).
										These galaxies are gravitationally lensed, meaning that they appear much
										brighter than they do intrinsically, and they can be observed at much higher spatial
										resolutions. Overall, this allows an incredibly detailed study of the galaxies. My current
										project involves using NIRSpec observations of two of the four TEMPLATES targets, which are
										dusty star-forming galaxies selected by the South Pole Telescope (SPT). I am using the Hα and
										[NII] emission lines to study how the fraction of metals in the interstellar medium (ISM)
										varies spatially across the source.</p>

									<p>You can read the paper, published in ApJ, <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...958...64B/abstract">here.</a></p>

									<p>One of the primary goals of TEMPLATES is to create and share resources for the community,
									that will assist in working with the plethora of spectacular data which has become available
									in the early phase of JWST. Our data reduction cookbooks can be found
										<a href="https://github.com/JWST-Templates/jwst_templates">here</a>, and some other useful
									tools we have developed can be found
										<a href="https://github.com/JWST-Templates/jwst_templates">here</a>.</p>

								<h2>CRISTAL collaboration</h2>
									<p>I am also a member of the
										<a href="https://www.alma-cristal.info/">CRISTAL: [CII] Resolved
											ISM in Star-Forming Galaxies with ALMA</a> collaboration, an ALMA
									Cycle-8 Large Program that observed 19 star-forming galaxies at z~4-5 in [CII]
									line and dust continuum emission. This sample was selected to include galaxies that
									are representative of the typical population at this epoch, around 1.5 billion years
									after the Big Bang. Future observations with JWST will also contribute heavily to
									the study of this sample. The four scientific areas we are aiming to study are shown
									below. My work is primarily focused on detecting outflows.</p>

								<h2>Dusty star-forming galaxy kinematics</h2>
									<p>One of the most pressing questions regarding the dusty star-forming galaxy population is of how
										their rapid star formation is triggered: are they predominantly merger-driven starbursts? Or
										can smooth gas accretion from the intergalactic medium (IGM) be sufficient to generate the
										observed star-formation rates? To address this we study galaxy kinematics, which tells us about
										the internal motions of the system. We use resolved observations of the Hα emission line
										to measure galaxy rotational velocities and velocity dispersions, and compare the two to draw
										conclusions about how dusty star-forming galaxies are supported. In general, we find that they
										are rapidly rotating systems that also experience high levels of turbulence. This turbulence
										could be driven by ongoing star formation, infall of cold gas, or mergers and interactions with
										other galaxies.</p>

									<p style="margin-bottom:2cm;">This work is part of our ongoing Large Programme with the K-band Multi-Object Spectrograph
										(KMOS) - known as "KMOS-ALMA Observations of Submillimetre Sources", or "KAOSS" for short.
										This LP will eventually have involved around 400 hours of KMOS time, and has already produced
										one of the largest samples of resolved kinematics for high-redshift dusty star-forming
										galaxies.</p>

								<h2>Molecular gas in dusty star-forming galaxies</h2>
									<p>As the fuel for star formation, molecular gas is a highly important component of galaxies to
										study. For high-redshift galaxies the most commonly used molecular gas tracer is carbon
										monoxide (CO), which emits at ~mm wavelengths. We recently detected CO emission in 47 DSFGs
										using ALMA and NOEMA, providing one of the largest samples currently available for this
										population. The data show that the dusty population typically contains huge reservoirs of
										molecular gas, which we expect to be consumed on short timescales. We also find evidence to
										suggest that these galaxies are related to the most massive elliptical galaxies in the local
									Universe. </p>
