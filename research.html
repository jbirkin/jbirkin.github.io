            <h2>3-D modelling of JWST data</h2>
            <p>I am a member of the international collaboration <a
                    href="https://sites.google.com/view/jwst-templates/">TEMPLATES</a>,
               an on-going programme designed to spatially resolve the star formation in four galaxies at the peak of
               cosmic star formation. These galaxies are gravitationally lensed, meaning that they appear much
               brighter than they do intrinsically, and they can be observed at much higher spatial
               resolutions. Overall, this allows an incredibly detailed study of the galaxies.
               As an expert in near-infrared IFU obeservations, my role is to extract the relevant data features to
               give a complete picture of the underlying systems while effectively visualizing the data. To this end,
               I developed a powerful <a href="https://github.com/jbirkin/cubespecfit">open-source Python module</a>
               which simultaneously models the emission from the galaxy and
               produces a complete visual of the entire cube. I utilized this tool to produce <a

               my role is to combine the 3-D data from CRISTAL to boost the signal-to-noise ratio and identify faint
               emission features. For this project I have utilized dimensionality reduction techniques, data
               normalization, MCMC model fitting, model selection, bootstrap/jacknife resampling and feature
               engineering.

            <h2>Data-Driven Insights into Turbulent Galactic Disks</h2>
            <p>In grad school I led the processing and analysis of a ~300GB Large Program, with the goal of
               understanding
               the 2-D kinematics of highly star-forming systems. The data processing and cleaning involved PCA
               analysis and sigma clipping to reduce noise. After cross-matching the data with existing databases, I
               applied an adaptive binning technique to model the 3-D data and extract 1-D rotation curves for the
               galaxies. Below is a visualization of the rotation fields of each galaxy in the sample, plotted as a
               function of two basic system properties. <a

            <h2>Molecular gas in dusty star-forming galaxies</h2>
            <p>Leveraging data from state-of-the-art facilities, I modelled the radio emission of early-Universe
               galaxies to provide insights into their underlying properties. To prepare this dataset I utilized
               advanced algorithmic cleaning and feature extraction from multi-baseline observations, which I
               modelled using Bayesian Inference. I combined my measurements with a wide variety of archival data
               using catalog matching techniques, which enhanced the robustness of the statistical conclusions I was
               able to draw. <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.501.3926B/abstract">This work was
